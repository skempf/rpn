#+TITLE: README
A simple RPN calculator written in Lisp.

I like to use this code when I need a floating point value in a shell script. But, for fun, I wanted to have a REPL.

The original version was written in Fortran, but this project was a chance to learn Lisp.

In a shell script, it is easy to capture the result in a shell parameter:

p=$(rpn 1 2 3 sum)

Available operations:

- standard mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, sqrt, sq, abs)
  - "x" is an alias for "*"
- trigometric functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh)
- exponential (exp -- natural logarithm, ln, log10, log)
- special
  - ! -- factorial ("fac" is alias)
  - sum -- sum all numbers on the stack
  - prod -- product of all numbers on the stack
  - mean -- average of all numbers on the stack
  - show -- print the stack
  - ent -- repeat last value
  - clear -- clear the stack
  - quit -- end REPL
  - deg2rad -- convert number to radians
  - rad2deg -- convert number to degrees
  - min -- minimum of two numbers
  - max -- maximum of two numbers
  - mod -- modulus
  - rem -- remainder
